A CK2 After the End Fan Fork submod for my friends and me.

This is my lockdown project! I love Crusader Kings II - particularly the After the End Fan Fork mod - and I also want to learn to code. Although I know modding is not the same as programming, I think a passion project would be perfect to explore my interest. I am starting this with absolutely no knowledge of programming or coding or anything - absolutely zero ... e.g. it took me awhile to figure out how to create a New Folder to store my mod. 

My journey will start small: first, I will create a few traits. Then I will create some characters. Eventually I want to populate the After the End world with myself and my friends, fully fleshed out with events, kingdoms, etc, so that each one is as flavourful as some of the mod's more dynamic characters (such as Prince Ali or Levi the Liberator).
